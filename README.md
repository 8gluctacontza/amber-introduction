# Introduction

**Amber** is a web application framework written in [Crystal](http://www.crystal-lang.org). Homepage is at [amberframework.org](https://amberframework.org/), docs are on [Amber Docs](https://docs.amberframework.org). Github repository is at [amberframework/amber](https://github.com/amberframework/amber), and the chat is on FreeNode IRC (channel #amber) or on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/amberframework/amber).

Amber is simple to get used to, and much more intuitive than frameworks like Rails. (But it does inherit the concepts from Rails that are good.)

This document is here to describe everything that Amber offers out of the box, sorted in a logical order and easy to consult repeatedly over time. The Crystal level is not described; it is expected that the readers coming here have a formed understanding of Crystal and its features.
